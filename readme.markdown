Excel Diff
==========

A script to render an excel (.xlsx) workbook as text 
suitable to use with `diff` to get readable diffs, for example 
with Git.



Inspired by [`git_diff_xlsx`](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/~ucftpw2/2013/10/18/Using+git+for+version+control+of+spreadsheet+models+-+part+1+of+3).
